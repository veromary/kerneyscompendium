Kerney's Compendium of Ancient and Modern History


The Greece section I based on the 1893 version, Corrected, enlarged and brought forward to 1880 by John O'Kane Murray MA, MD., then similarly edited to bring it up to 1893 by the Publishers John Murphy and Co.

Then I found Kerney's first version

The 1893 version lists the questions like running footnotes at the bottom of each page.  The 1845 version gives these questions in an Appendix.

The 1893 version also uses lots of //italics// and features the use of the Prime or Acute symbol after the accented syllable in unfamiliar words, which is a bit of a pain to typeset in LaTeX, but a helpful thing in itself.

The 1845 version is badly scanned and cuts off the edges of some pages.

I have been putting questions at the end of each chapter.
